Computer Vision UTILity toolkit (CVUTIL)
----------------------------------------
cvutil is a C++ computer vision library that extends the functionality of OpenCV. The library contains some functions that are frequently used computer vision developers for convenience. The library uses multi-threading, vectorization routines available in Intel's AVX 2.0 to execute algorithms in the library. The optimizaion can be disabled optionally.

Dependencies
------------
The library depends on OpenCV and Qt libraries. Please get the OpenCV 4.1 and Qt 5.12.3 libraries when using the cvutil library and compiling the source.
