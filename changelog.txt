version 1.3
-----------
New features:
* Optimization can be optionally disabled when initializing cvutil
  library.
* Added license information to source code.

Fixes:
* cvutil_core.cpp:getConnectedComponents() - The function is fixed to 
  perform connected components using either 4 or 8 connectivity.
* stdproto.h: Removed unneeded APIs - pthread and pylon references.
* Converted code to use native C++ threading.
* cvutil_bwdist.cpp: The algorithm now creates threads based on the 
  number of logical cores on the system.
* cvutil_bwskel.cpp: Rearranged and added AVX 2.0 optimization code 
  to location::isridge() for faster execution.
* cvutil_bwskel.cpp: Added location::xh8() to count 8-connected 
  components in adjacent pixels (Ref: Guo-Hall Thinning algorithm).
* cvutil_bwskel.cpp:bwskel() Fixed performance bugs where the program 
  took unusually longer time to skeletonize when the images were 
  thresholded at various levels.
* cvutil_core:getLargestConnectedComponent() The function now returns
  an 8-bit pixel size zero matrix with one pixel when no maximum value 
  is found, to prevent crash in functions where an 8-bit matrices are 
  expected.
* cvutil_core.cpp:bwskel() The function is fixed to pass exact precise
  distance transform without rounding.
* cvutil_core.cpp:addBorder() The function is fixed to honor thickness
  argument when adding border pixels to a single channel image.
* cvutil_matlab_interface:FloorCeilFunctions All the functiona in the 
  namespace is modified to check for CPU_AVX2 instead of CPU_AVX for 
  vector processing.
* cvutil_videowriter.h: Fixed include guards and dead web link.
* demo.h: Fixed to use C++ random_device instead of rand() for longer
  periodicity.

version 1.2
-----------
New features:
* Added Macros in stdproto.h to aid in detection of memory leaks
  in the source code.
* Implemented precise euclidean distance transform in cvutil_bwdist.cpp
* Implemented ridge detection on distance transforms in cvutil_bwskel. 
  Also, numerous rules were implemented to generate a connected skeleton 
  for each connected component in the binary image.

Fixes:
* cvutil_matlab_interface.cpp:cvutil::floor() and cvutil::ceil() - Fixed 
  the functions where they return empty matrices when a matrix of double
  precision floating-point values (CV_64F) are passed.

Version 1.1
-----------
New feature:
* Added functionality to create videos from processed images
  using two new classes, DefaultVideoWriter and FrameWriter.

Fixes:
* ind2sub() fixed to correctly generate subscripts when the 
  number of channels is one.
* window() fails when a matrix of different size is passed
  using the same window name that was used earlier.
* bwskel() wrongly creates skeleton due to floating point
  inaccuracies from the distance transform.
* Fixed ForEachFileInPath() to parse the list of image file 
  names in natural sorting.

Version 1.0
