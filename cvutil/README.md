Computer Vision UTILity toolkit (CVUTIL)
----------------------------------------
cvutil is a C++ computer vision library that extends 
the functionality of OpenCV. The library contains some
functions that are frequently used computer vision 
developers for convenience. The library uses multi-
threading, vectorization routines available in Intel's
AVX 2.0 to execute algorithms in the library. The 
optimizaion can be disabled optionally.

Dependencies
------------
The library depends on OpenCV and Qt libraries. Please 
get the latest OpenCV and Qt libraries when using the 
cvutil library and compiling the source.
